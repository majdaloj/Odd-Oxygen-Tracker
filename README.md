## General info
A python project that observers real life data of emission regulations and their effect in Canada through odd oxygen observations. Using the National Air Pollution Suerveillence (NAPS) Program, we have analyzed "ambient air quality data" with nearly 260 stations dating back to 1969 from the Government of Canada. We complied various emission regulations passed within that time frame and have created a GUI to display whether there were any effects on the air quality levels.
